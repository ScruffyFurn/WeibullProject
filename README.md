# WeibullProject


To run the project you will need Visual Studio 2015 with [R Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/rtvs/installation) installed 

***Note I am using R 3.3.2***

The data sets are Test and Test2 Excel files. The two column heads are Fail and Time. Each row is a single part in a part batch. If the Fail column is a F that means the part failed, if the Fail column is S that means the part did not fail. The time column is the month in service.
